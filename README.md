# PDF-XChange Stamp Import Helper

This repo has one Windows batch script that makes importing JavaScript-enabled stamp PDFs into **PDF-XChange Editor** way less painful.

## What it does
- checks that PDF-XChange is installed and closed
- lets you pick a `.pdf` stamp file from the same folder
- walks you through creating the stamp in the app
- swaps in your original PDF so your dynamic stamp logic keeps working

## Quick use
1. Put your stamp `.pdf` files next to `1-PDF-XChange Import Script.bat`.
2. Double-click the batch file.
3. Follow the prompts.

That’s it — rerun it any time you want to import another stamp.
